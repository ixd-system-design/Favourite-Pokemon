# Favourite Pokemon
This demo illustrates how we can combine Third Party Data from [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co) with our own backend API. The app allows users to mark Third Party data (pokemon) as 'favourites' by storing them in MongoDB.

## Iteration
You may be able to borrow this pattern for use in other contexts where a favourites feature is useful.
